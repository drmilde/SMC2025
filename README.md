## Abstract

This paper presents a novel system for designing synthesizer interfaces, focusing on a human-centred approach. It explores the challenges of traditional synthesizer interfaces and proposes a flexible system using paper prototypes enhanced with 3D-printed controls and webcam tracking. The system allows for intuitive manipulation of sound parameters through physical interaction with these elements, offering a low-cost and adaptable method for creating both conventional and experimental musical instrument interfaces. The systemâ€™s potential is illustrated through use cases involving the recreation of an analogue synthesizer interface and the control of a multi-channel auditory display. The research aims to bridge the gap between the technical complexity of sound synthesis and the creative expression of musicians.
